Cinema Scope
=============

This scope queries [TMDb](http://themoviedb.org) for movies and tv shows and allows people to have fast access to various information, including trailers.
It was written for the [Ubuntu Scope Showdown](http://developer.ubuntu.com/showdown/)

Compile and run
=============

In order to have a functional scope you need to insert a developer key into [config.h](include/api/config.h); just go to [TMDb](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io) and register a new account.
For compiling and running you can use the Ubuntu SDK.
